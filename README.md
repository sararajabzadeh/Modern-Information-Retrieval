# Modern Information Retrieval

We had a project that contained 3 phases:

The first phase was about Preprocessing, Indexing, Index compression, searching and retrieving of some texts in Farsi and English. 

The second phase was about implementing Naive Bayes, KNN, SVM, Random Forest and Evaluating them. This phase also contained first phase improvement.

The third phase was about implementing clustering algorithms - KMeans, Gaussian Mixture Model and Hierarchical clustering- and crawler. It also contained PageRank algorithm.
